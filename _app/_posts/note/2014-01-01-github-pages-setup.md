## The Problem

Unfortunately this project doesn't work with GitHub Pages or GitHub Pages for projects. There're some factors that prevent it from generating pages:

- Many features Almace Scaffolding provides like LiveReload, Sass support, inline SVG, and HTML minification are implemented using [Grunt.js](http://gruntjs.com/), it's not supported by GitHub Pages.
- Almace Scaffolding uses the latest pre-release Jekyll, so not all features are supported by GitHub Pages renderers.
- GItHub Pages build server [overwrites the `source` settings](https://help.github.com/articles/pages-don-t-build-unable-to-run-jekyll#source-setting). This prevent it generating pages from current file structure.

## The Solution

I know this can be tricky and more verbose than uploading your Jekyll site directly to your repository. However GitHub Pages support static HTML pages, a workaround solution for using Almace Scaffolding on GitHub Pages is treating your Jekyll site as static pages:

- Build your site locally (`grunt build`).
- Upload Jekyll generated static files to your `username.github.io` repository.

If you'd like to keep all things under Git control, you can try the following file structure:

```
├── _amsf/ (Almace Scaffolding source code)
├── *.html (Jekyll-generated static pages)
└── README.md (your own readme)
```

You can see this [live demo](https://github.com/amsf/amsf.github.io/) how to make them friends.
