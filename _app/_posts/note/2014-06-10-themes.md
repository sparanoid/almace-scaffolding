## Overview

In the latest build, I've added multiple themes support, finally, you can switch themes with just one command.

<p class="note">This is an experimental feature and may change until the feature stabilizes.</p>

## Installing Themes

The AMSF framework ships a default theme [Curtana](https://github.com/amsf/amsf-curtana). You can also install as many themes as you like and switch to the one you prefer at any time.


### Via Git (GitHub)

The easiest way to install a new theme is via `theme-add`, the following command will install theme Curtana from its official repo `amsf/amsf-curtana`:

```sh
$ grunt theme-add --theme=curtana
```

If you'd install a custom theme from other users, append `--user` in your command, the following command will install a new theme named `bootstrap-sass` from `sparanoid/amsf-bootstrap-sass`

```sh
$ grunt theme-add --theme=bootstrap-sass --user=sparanoid
```

### Manually Install

You can also install themes manually. find an AMSF theme (Curtana, for example), download the package and uncompress all files to `.amsf-cache/themes` directory, the file structure should look like:

```
├── .amsf-cache/ (Almace Scaffolding cache directory)
|   ├── themes/
|   |   └── curtana/
|   |   |   └── assets/
|   |   |   └── includes/
|   |   |   └── layouts/
|   |   |   └── pages/
|   |   |   └── config.yml
└── _app/
```

Then execute the following command:

```sh
$ grunt activate --theme=curtana
```

Your current theme will be backed up to `.amsf-cache/themes/your-old-theme/` and the new theme `curtana` will be installed to the appropriate directories.

## Upgrading Themes

You can update your current activated theme by the following command. The activated theme will be downloaded from GitHub automatically if there's any update:

```sh
$ grunt theme-update
```

Please note that only themes added via GitHub can be updated.
