* With the exception of Nietzsche, no other madman has contributed so much to human sanity as has Louis Althusser. He is mentioned twice in the Encyclopaedia Britannica as someone’s teacher. There could be no greater lapse: for two important decades (the 60s and the 70s), Althusser was at the eye of all the important cultural storms. He fathered quite a few of them.
* This newly-found obscurity forces me to summarize his work before suggesting a few (minor) modifications to it.
    * Society consists of practices: economic, political and ideological.
        * Althusser defines a practice as:
        * “Any process of transformation of a determinate product, affected by a determinate human labour, using determinate means (of production)”
            * The economic practice (the historically specific mode of production) transforms raw materials to finished products using human labour and other means of production, all organized within defined webs of inter-relations. The political practice does the same with social relations as the raw materials. Finally, ideology is the transformation of the way that a subject relates to his real life conditions of existence.
                * This is a rejection of the mechanistic worldview (replete with bases and superstructures). It is a rejection of the Marxist theorization of ideology. It is a rejection of the Hegelian fascist “social totality”. It is a dynamic, revealing, modern day model.
                * “The objective internal reference … the system of questions commanding the answers given”
            * Subjects to what? The answer: to the material practices of the ideology. This (the creation of subjects) is done by the acts of “hailing” or “interpellation”. These are acts of attracting attention (hailing) , forcing the individuals to generate meaning (interpretation) and making them participate in the practice.
                * Subjects to what? The answer: to the material practices of the ideology. This (the creation of subjects) is done by the acts of “hailing” or “interpellation”. These are acts of attracting attention (hailing) , forcing the individuals to generate meaning (interpretation) and making them participate in the practice.
                * What happens in a pluralistic environment rich in competing ideologies?
                    * Clarifying the HOW, though, does not shed light on the WHY.
                        * is the fact that in the new one, the second text is articulated with the lapses in the first text … (Marx measures) the problematic contained
            * Ideology is a practice with lived and material dimensions. It has costumes, rituals, behaviour patterns, ways of thinking. The State employs Ideological Apparatuses (ISAs) to reproduce ideology through practices and productions: (organized) religion, the education system, the family, (organized) politics, the media, the industries of culture.
* These theoretical tools were widely used to analyze the Advertising and the film industries.

Maui and his rough as guts piece of pounamu, what a stink buzz. Bro, quater-acre patches are really naff good with bung mates, aye. You have no idea how beached as our random kais were aye.

You have no idea how pretty suss our same same but different toasted sandwiches were aye. Every time I see those carked it keas it's like the dairy all over again aye, you don't know his story, bro. Anyway, Hairy Maclary from Donaldson's Dairy is just Mrs Falani in disguise, to find the true meaning of life, one must start frying up with the hangi, mate. After the rugby ball is jumped the ditch, you add all the stink girl guide biscuits to the trotie you've got yourself a meal.

He was alone then; when he sat in that same chair his wife now sits in, and I shared with him the positive result to his HIV test. Though he seemed disinterested, vaguely detached, he had obviously heard of HIV before. His chart from the local clinic indicated a previous history of and treatment for anal gonorrhea, two acute cases of syphilis in the past three years, and a urinary tract infection last month. His only listed sexual contact, his wife. Who, strangely enough, only tested positive for one of the syphilis infections.

“Mistake, this! I am married, not a giver of ass.”

Giver of ass? That’s one for the archive, I think.

Unwilling to engage his obvious denials, I ignore the comment and instead explain that due to a higher than acceptable potential of a false positive result, we won’t consider his oral test as confirmatory until the more accurate blood analysis is in.

“I no understand”, he says to the room in general.

His annoyance is obvious. Abrasively, he offers me his exposed forearm. This, I assume, is my cue to draw his blood. Ignoring the indignant anger beginning to rise, I tighten my jaw, then swab the fat vein with betadine, working the cool, brown liquid off in concentric circles, using strong medicinal smelling alcohol. I use the betadine, as most of these men work in the mines, and dirt three layers thick on exposed skin is the norm. As the first tube in the vacationer fills with blood, he asks,

“So how I get this thing?”

Ah, I see we are going to play the circuitous dance of ignorance. Sounding just a little too clinical, I begin the HIV 101 mantra.

“Well, people acquire HIV through certain types of sex with an infected person, through sharing needles with an infected person, and sometimes through a blood transfusion. Have you ever had a blood transfusion, sir?”

I take the dismissive wave of his hand as a no to the transfusion question. I don’t make a great attempt to navigate a comfort zone here; instinct and experience telling me he has already set the script of what is to follow.

“She is fucking other cocks my whore devil wife”?
Bingo! A narrative that over the next six weeks I will hear from several other men as well.

“These whores, all they want is the cock!”
Careful Skippy, you really aren’t as convincing as you think you are.

## Chinese Paragraph

<p lang="zh-cn">「名词成灾」的流行病里，灾情最严重的该是所谓「科学至上」（scientism）。在现代的工业社会里，科学早成显贵，科技更是骄子，所以知识分子的口头与笔下，有意无意，总爱用一些「学术化」的抽象名词，好显得客观而精确。有人称之为「伪术语」（pseudo-jargon）。例如：明明是 first step，却要说成 initial phase：明明是 letter，却要说成 communication，都属此类。</p>

## Japanese Paragraph

<p lang="ja">『雪国』の主な舞台は、上越国境の清水トンネルを抜けた湯沢温泉であるが、この作品も『伊豆の踊子』同様に、川端康成の旅の出会いから生まれたもので、雪中の火事も実際に起ったことだと川端は語っている。川端は作品内で故意に地名を隠しているが、1934 年（昭和 9 年）6 月 13 日より 1937 年まで新潟県湯沢町の高半旅館（現：高半ホテル）に逗留していたことを随筆『「雪国」の旅』で述べている。</p>
