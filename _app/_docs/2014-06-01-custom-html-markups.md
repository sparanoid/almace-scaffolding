## [Lightense Images](https://sparanoid.com/work/lightense-images/)

A simple library inspired by [Tim Holman](https://github.com/tholman) to view large images up close using simple mouse interaction, and the full screen.

### Usage

Add the following setting to your post [front-matter field](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/):

```
plugin: lightense
```

Markdown markup:

```md
![Image](https://sparanoid.com/photo.jpg)
```

Lightense Images is activated globally by default, if you want to disable this effect for specific image, you can simply apply `.no-lightense` CSS class to your image or `<img>`:

```md
![Image](https://sparanoid.com/logo.png){: .no-lightense}
```

Please note that if you're using HTML markup, you should wrap your images into a `<p>` container.

### Example

![Moonstruck Princess Extended - Red]({{ site.file }}/moonstruck-princess-ext-red.jpg)

## Image Sizes

There're different size helpers for images. They're available using the following CSS classes:

### Small Size

```md
![Image](https://sparanoid.com/logo.png){: .size-small}
```

![Moonstruck Princess Extended - orange]({{ site.file }}/moonstruck-princess-ext-orange.jpg){: .size-small}

### Medium Size

Medium size is the default size of images, so you don't need additional CSS class for it.

```md
![Image](https://sparanoid.com/logo.png)
```

![Moonstruck Princess Extended - Yellow]({{ site.file }}/moonstruck-princess-ext-yellow.jpg)

### Large Size

```md
![Image](https://sparanoid.com/logo.png){: .size-large}
```

![Moonstruck Princess Extended - Green]({{ site.file }}/moonstruck-princess-ext-green.jpg){: .size-large}

### Aligned Images

```md
![Image](https://sparanoid.com/logo.png){: .size-left}

![Image](https://sparanoid.com/logo.png){: .size-right}
```

![Moonstruck Princess Extended - Blue]({{ site.file }}/moonstruck-princess-ext-blue.jpg){: .size-left}

Aligned images are smaller images beside text, you can just apply `.size-left` or `.size-right` to your images and nothing special markup required. However that aligned images will be responded to normal large size for small desktops or mobile devices.
