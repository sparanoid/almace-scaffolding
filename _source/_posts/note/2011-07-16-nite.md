  <p>Last time I redesign my site <a href="{% post_url /note/2011-05-06-cyrconplex %}/">I said</a> “Oh this time it looks great I’m going to use it for long enough”. But less than two month I redesigned my site again. It at first inspired by <a href="http://lifepath.me/">Lifepath</a>, I create a <a href="/lab/start/">start page</a> for my Safari default homepage (It looks really nice and you can have a try). I’m satisfied with this style then I deployed it to the whole site. <del>The style what you’re looking at.</del></p>

  <p>I can’t really get what can I do with my site, except redesigning it from time to time.</p>
