  <p>The new theme is out. <del>Just what you’re looking at,</del> it’s still work-in-progress, based on HTML5 and CSS 3. It looks great on a Webkit brwoser. New Firefox 4 should look fine too. IE 10 may also work except border-radius and animations. The source code can be accessed at <del datetime="2010-10-15T11:23:56+00:00">Google Code</del> <a href="http://github.com/sparanoid/lindsay-koinaka">GitHub</a>, however it’s the first time I’m trying things like this. bug reports, comments, suggestions, and ideas for improvements are welcome.</p>
